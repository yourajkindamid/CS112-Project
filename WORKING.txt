    //First of all the program will have a login page and signup page.
    //All new users will have to go to the sign up page as they will not have an account.
    //The sign up page will ask the user to enter their name, email, username, password and code.
    //The code will be used to check whether the user is a student, professor or admin.
    //The codes will be provided in a README file beforehand.
    //According to the code provided, the user will be signed up as either an admin, professor or a student.
    //All the sign-up data will be saved using file handling.

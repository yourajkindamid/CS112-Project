For our C++ OOP semester project, we propose developing a Learning Management System (LMS) with separate login portals for students and professors, incorporating key functionalities 
such as student attendance tracking, course registration, grade management, test and quiz administration, and mess bill payments. By leveraging object-oriented programming principles 
like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, we aim to create a modular, maintainable, and scalable system. Our goal is to deliver a well-structured and fully functional LMS 
that effectively demonstrates OOP concepts.
